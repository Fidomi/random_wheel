#### General Info

WORK STILL IL PROGRESS...

- Create a wheel with several segments (max 20)
- Give them a name
- Launch the wheel so it will spin and give you the first name of the draw
- The segment of the picked name is deleted and the wheel spins again and so on.
- When only one segment lasts, you'll get the final ranking of the draw
