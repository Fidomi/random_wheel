#### General Info

-   Create a wheel with several segments (max 10)
-   Give them a name
-   Launch the wheel so it will spin and give you the first name of the draw
-   The segment of the picked name is deleted and the wheel spins again and so on.
-   When only one segment lasts, you'll get the final ranking of the draw
